* "We can conclude that in order to obtain high accuracy of the final products, a density of 1 GCP/200m^2 is necessary". [Determining the Optimum Number of Ground
Control Points for Obtaining High Precision Results
Based on UAS Images]

* "a uniform coverage of GCPs is preferential across the area of interest". "errors from this source can enter the decimetre range in locations greater than ~100 m from the nearest GCP".
